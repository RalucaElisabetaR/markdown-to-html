	<h3> A Funny Story </h3>

	<p> 
		 Vienna, Austria. <br>
		 Clubbing with my girlfriends.<br>
		 A lady sitting by herself. <br>
		 I feel sorry for her. No one should be in a dance club all alone.<br>
		 I tell my friends: <i> I'm going to chat with her and ask her to come sit with us.</i> <br>
		 I go and say Hi. <br>
		 I introduced myself. <br>
		 I ask her to come join us.
		 She says: <i> Go away, leave me alone! </i> ðŸ˜³ <br>
		 I say to my friends: <i> She must feel really lonely. Some people say they want to be alone but they don't really want that.</i> <br>
		 I am not willing to give up. <br>
		 So I insist. <br>
		 Several times.<br>
		 <b> I never give up on people.</b> ðŸ™„<br>
		 She keeps telling me to go away.<br>
		 She is more and more annoyed with me.<br>
		 After many... many attempts, I give up.<br>
		 We later find that she is a sex-worker and me being around her is interfering with her business.<br>
	
	 </p>

 	<p>
 		 To this day my friends are recalling: <i> Raluca, remember when you did not want to give up on that lady, while all she wanted was for you to go away and stop messing up her business? </i>
 	</p>



	<h2> TLDR: </h2> 

 	 <p> I mistook a sex-worker for a lonely lady.ðŸ¤ª </p>
